This is an audio manager for unity which utilizes audio source pooling. Create an Audio Manager GameObject, assign the AudioManager script to it and drag the “Audio Source Element” prefab to the “Pooled Object” field in the inspector. Assign the AudioLibrary script to any GameObject. From there you can assign audio clips to the “Sounds” array and play them using the PlaySound method.
