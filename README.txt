This audio manager provides a simplified and more performant way of working with audio in unity.  
To use it, create an empty GameObject and drag the “AudioManager” script into it. 

AudioLibrary script contains an array of audio clips each with their own settings (e.g. volume, pitch). To play them use the “PlaySound” method.
